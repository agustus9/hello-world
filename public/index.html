          <h1>A brief history of web design for designers</h1>

    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p id="first">Over the last 30 years the web has gone through a lot of changes. 
      The advent of <strong>Graphic User Interface</strong> has taken the web to a whole list of possibilities.
      Now users are able to become more interactive with web pages and are able to customize pages to their liking.
      The web has been through it's ups and downs with newer technologies being develop.
      Flash in the 1990's was a hugh break through but with a few draw backs. Flash took up a lot of resourses like
      load times and proccessing power.</p>

    <p class="second">The future of the web seems very bright. 
    We are now able to create dynamic pages with ease 
    and add functunality that was unavaible doing the earlier years of the web.
    The MVC model is in my opinion is a great step in designing and developing web pages. 
    Many languages like, <strong>ASP, Angular, and Ruby on Rails</strong> have adaptive this model 
    and continue to thrive in web development because of it. Mobile development has also become one of
    the front runners in development today. Many users use their portable devices to
    connect and to communicate over the web these days.</p>
